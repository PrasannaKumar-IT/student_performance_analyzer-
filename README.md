# 🎓 Student Performance Analyzer using Probability Distributions

This mini project simulates student exam data and analyzes it using core probability distributions. It's designed to help beginners understand how **Normal**, **Uniform**, and **Binomial** distributions apply in real-world educational settings — and how to visualize them effectively.

---

## 📌 Features

- Simulate exam scores using **Normal Distribution**
- Simulate attendance percentages using **Uniform Distribution**
- Simulate pass/fail outcomes using **Binomial Distribution**
- Visualize all distributions with charts
- Export dataset as CSV for further analysis

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understand real-life use cases of probability distributions
- Practice using NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
- Learn how to generate, structure, and analyze synthetic data

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

---

## 📈 Charts

- Histogram of exam scores (Normal)
- Histogram of attendance (Uniform)
- Bar chart of pass/fail outcomes (Binomial)
